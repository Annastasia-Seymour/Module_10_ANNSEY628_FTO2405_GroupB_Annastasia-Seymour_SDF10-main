## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

[An API performs the function of a middle man , it is the bridge of communication between two things like the frontend development and backend development in programming. Because API's are stateless i wouldnt delay when sending and retrieving data request.
A real life scenario : pretty boring example but anyway a laptop - mouse would be an API because it would communicate with my computer what I want it to do , which is click and hover over things, which on the machine will open or close programmes, i do not see the process that takes place between the machine and the mouse, i just see the results. Just thought of it now but APIs are also like body guards they wil gatekeep and control who interacts with the system and under what authority. Depending on the level of authorisation will determine the level of access control. You would talk to the bodyguard (or secretary) before speaking directly to the CEO or Big Boss (systems) and you dont see the communications between either party but i get my results.]

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

[An API describes how you can use available methods and functions to perform specific tasks or obtain info ,whereas an interface describes what those methods and functions can do. The difference between API and interface in terms of interaction is based on how you interact with them. As an example an interface would be the buttons on a remote , each button does something unique. If you press a buttton you'll make things happen directly. An API would be the wiring in the TV you don't directly interact with it but in pressing the button on the remote you are thereby sending a request via the remote to the tv for the API to get a response back.]

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

[Api are defined by their:
endpoints = the address to which it is pointing toward.
http methods = whether to fetch , create, update or remove data from the server. 
Request Parameters = addtitional information sent with the API that could change the behaviour of the request or add new specifics. 
Response format = API will specify how they will respod to requests eg like JSON or XML(slowly phasing out) where a request is either successful (200) or unsuccessful "unfounded" (404) or server error(500). 

I find RESTful to be the most intriguing, due to its nature which is stateless , all info that it carries is all necessary which means it maximizes all the content it carries between requests. that is why its so reliable it doesnt take on unnecessary baggage and or keep it stored. The fact that it is compatible with other platforms with out hassle of preloading an app in order to access it. The design is easy to understand and apply. ]

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

[I dont think i have much experince with API but what does come to mind is Github as i have made requests to it to GET POST PUT and DELETE repositories , ive checked and GitHub provides API documentation. I can interact with the community and make contributions. With commits i am able to identify changes i have made to code that caused changes or errors in my code and rollback where relevant which kinda encourages experimening with the code (what change cause this outcome). I can also discover other projects from fellow developers and gain inspiration and insight (also by forking i am able to duplicate without affecting the main branch). ]

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

[Although i am still learning i think i am most confident in using Github as my API tool for the moment, I think as the modules progress i will get more exposure to more advanced versions of APIs. just need to master the basics or elementary stuff(fundamental teachings)first.]
